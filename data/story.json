    "Do you have it in you to make it alive in Dystopia Denvertown? Think again. Decide wisely.",
    "We knew you had it in you but I wonder if you'd feel the same when you see them. Or they see you.",
    "As you crouch under the broken remains of some spare broken makeshift studio with jagged edges, you squint. Just then, you hear voices...",
    "Two cats, in matched armours and feather hats walk by the studio and your breath is caught in your teeth as you try to listen. 'Cat Donut': Security swipes for today are almost over, meeaw. 'Cat Crouton'': Is it though? Supreme Cat smells human activity today.",
    "In Dystopia Denvertown, there is nothing but supremacy. And cats. Can you make it through this challenge to defeat them?",



    "We get it! Braving the land of Denvertown with its cat army that has taken over with bloodbath isn't for the faint of heart.",
    "What do you call a cat crossed with a fish?",
    "Cat Arlo: Nope, you are no good! Always had my doubts.",



    "How many cats can you put in an empty box?",
    "A cat had three kittens named Smug, Happy and Darth. What was the name of the cat",

    

    "You did well, hooman! But this got you nowhere, oh you and your trust. Always so fun to play with. Bye, all the brainstorming was useless (Haah!)",
    "Cat Supreme has been defeated and you should be very proud of yourself. The kittens are ready to embrace you as their new ruler."
